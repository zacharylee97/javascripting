[Verse]
Tell me why you gotta look at me that way
You know what it does to me
So baby, what you tryna say? Ayy
Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me? Mmm
I got you, I got you dreamin'
You close your eyes and you're screamin'
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy

[Chorus]
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, ah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go

[Bridge]
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, ah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go

[Post-Chorus]
I know how you want it, baby, just like this
Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss
While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips
I know what you want, but you can't have this

[Outro]
Want to say goodnight
Want to say goodnight and go
Want to say goodnight
Baby, say goodnight and go
Want to say goodnight
Say goodnight and go
